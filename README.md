# Store Database Project üõí

This is the README file for the project to create a store database using SQL.

## Project Description üìù

The goal of this project is to design and create a database for a fictional store. The database will hold information about products, customers, invoices, genders, invoice details, person types, and product categories. SQL (Structured Query Language) will be used to define the database structure, create tables, establish relationships, and perform queries.

## Database Structure üóÑÔ∏è

The database will consist of the following main tables:

1. **Product**: This table will store information about the products the store offers, such as name, description, price, and the category they belong to.

2. **Person**: This table will contain details about individuals associated with the store, such as customers and employees. It includes information like names, addresses, and contact details.

3. **Invoice**: This table will record information about each invoice, including the date, customer, and total amount.

4. **Gender**: This table will maintain a list of possible genders for classifying individuals.

5. **InvoiceDetail**: This table will keep a record of products sold in each invoice, including the quantity and unit price.

6. **PersonType**: This table will define different types of individuals in the store, such as "Customer" and "Employee".

7. **Category**: This table will store the categories to which products belong, such as "Electronics," "Clothing," "Food," etc.

## Usage Instructions üöÄ

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure you have an SQL database server available, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
   - Run the table creation scripts (`create_tables.sql`) in the appropriate order to create the tables in the database.

2. **Initial Data Loading**:
   - Use the initial data loading scripts (`load_initial_data.sql`) to insert sample information into the tables.

3. **Queries and Operations**:
   - Utilize SQL queries to access database information.
   - Refer to example queries in the `example_queries.sql` file.

## Contributions ü§ù

This project is an educational and practice example, so formal contributions will not be accepted. However, if you identify errors or potential improvements in the database design or queries, feel free to make changes in a personal copy.
